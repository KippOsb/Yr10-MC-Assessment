## Algorithms Implemented
# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is one of the most basic and widely used algorithms in machine learning. It is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This section contains the implementation of both simple and multiple linear regression models.

# Key features:

Implementation of the linear regression model from scratch.
Visualization of the data and the fitted model.
Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. This section demonstrates how KNN can be applied to classify data points based on their proximity to other labeled points.

# Key features:

Implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification.
Discussion on choosing the optimal value of K.
Visualization of decision boundaries.

# Neural Networks Essay
This repository also includes an essay on Neural Networks, which are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The essay covers:

The basics of artificial neurons and neural networks.
The architecture of neural networks, including layers and activation functions.
Training neural networks using backpropagation and gradient descent.
Common applications of neural networks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.
The potential and challenges of neural networks in modern AI research.
